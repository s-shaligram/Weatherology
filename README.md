Weather App

The Weather App is a mobile application developed using Xcode and Swift, designed to provide users with real-time weather information. The app allows users to enter a location or use their current GPS location to fetch weather data for that specific location. It utilizes external API calls to retrieve weather data and displays the results in a user-friendly manner.

Features

Current Weather: Get the current weather conditions for a specific location, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.
GPS Location: Users can opt to use their device's GPS location to fetch weather data for their current location automatically.
User-friendly Interface: The app has an intuitive and visually appealing interface, making it easy for users to navigate and access weather information.

Technologies Used

Xcode: The primary Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for iOS app development.
Swift: The programming language used to build the iOS app.
Storyboard: Utilized for designing and visually laying out the app's user interface.
Postman: Used to test and debug API calls during the app's development process.
External API: The app integrates an external weather API to fetch real-time weather data.
Simulator: The iOS Simulator is utilized for testing and previewing the app's functionality on different iOS devices.

Getting Started

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the app on the iOS Simulator or a physical device.

How to Use

Upon launching the app, you'll be prompted to enter a location.
Once the location is provided, click the search icon button to retrieve weather data.
The app will display the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.

Acknowledgments

The Weather App was created as a learning project and is not intended for commercial use. It demonstrates how to make API calls, handle JSON data, and display weather information using the Swift programming language and Xcode development environment.

Please note that the weather data shown in the app is provided by the external API and may not always be entirely accurate or up-to-date.
